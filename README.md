# Multi--linear-Regression
Multi Regression projects: Car price prediction and 50 Startups profit analysis with EDA, transformations, and models.
📌 Overview
This repository contains two end-to-end **Multi Linear Regression (MLR)** projects:
1. **50_Startups Dataset** – Predicting company profit based on R&D, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State.
2. **Toyota Corolla Dataset** – Predicting car prices based on technical specifications and features.

Both projects include **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, **model building**, **evaluation**, and **process tracking** using **Notion.io**.
