# 🚗 Toyota Corolla Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **prediction model for car prices** using the Toyota Corolla dataset.  
We apply **Multi Linear Regression (MLR)** and explore **feature selection** techniques to improve prediction accuracy.  
The workflow includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data preprocessing**, **model building**, and **evaluation**.
